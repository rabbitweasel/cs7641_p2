Affine combination for mutation step
	Haupt's method Haupt, R. L., & Haupt, S. E. (2004). Practical Genetic Algorithms (2nd ed.). Hoboken: Wiley
	if mutation on value:
		pick x in continuous 0 <= x <= 1
		From parent A: total = (1-x)*A.value
		From parent B: total += x*B.value
	this will be for network weights (as per assignment instructions since using NN)

SA is terrible when there are a lot of peaks (e.g. choose a weight when number of connections in NN is high)
